[![Everything Is AWESOME]( https://bianca-ai.vercel.app/mqdefault.jpg )]( https://youtu.be/ZsoNCcIcb3U "BUGZ")

    Reanimation of old historic project "the bugs".
    where you evolve ANN Bugs. previosly writen in python
    no code surrived. features was 2d physicaly simulated container with
    bugs with simple task to learn not colide with each other and
    all red colorpainted objects.

    Bug featured 4 input sensors simply checking for red color pixsel
    and 4 (5) "actuators" physical impulse on x y ahis and rotation.

    the bug who surriwes longer emits next bath of ancestors.
    last itereations got even muttion of "morphology" aka
    position of inputs can change so interesting observations
    of evolutionary proceses take place.

    #Dependencies
        uses  JOK https://github.com/Jack-Ji/jok
        http  TOKAMAK https://github.com/cztomsik/tokamak

    #To doos:

        #for physics
            add trsuters
            make them fire with some gfx

        #for jok
            add simple ui.
            togle world/brain mode
            function to grid layout nurons position

        #for ann logic
            !move update from nurons to brai this is brin functin to update and mutate
            mutate weights function

        #for net
            *add simple server
            *make it nonblokng probably in separate tread;
            *crete response with bugz state
            *format bugstate responses to json
            create simple web ui here
                https://bianca-ai.vercel.app/
                kinda separate view
