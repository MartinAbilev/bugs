reanimation of old historic project "the bugs".
where you evolve ANN Bugs. previosly writen in python
no code surrived. features was 2d physicaly simulated container with
bugs with simple task to learn not colide with each other and
all red colorpainted objects.

Bug featured 4 input sensors simply checking for red color pixsel
and 4 (5) "actuators" physical impulse on x y ahis and rotation.

the bug who surriwes longer emits next bath of ancestors.
last itereations got even muttion of "morphology" aka
position of inputs can change so interesting observations
of evolutionary proceses take place.

to doos:

    code cleanup
    add trsuters
    make them fire with some gfx

    add simple ui.
    togle world/brain mode
    function to grid layout nurons position

test nuron firing in brain mode

mutate weights function
